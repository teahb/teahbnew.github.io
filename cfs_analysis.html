                           <p class="dark">In producer and actress Issa Rae’s Insecure, we follow the lives of two young black women, Issa and Molly, as they navigate work, relationships, and the world. With scenes showing racial microaggressions, reactions, and coping, Insecure continues the conversation around what it means to be happy, and if that is even achievable for black women in modern America. There is a lot to digest in the show, even in the pilot episode, which aired on October 9, 2016. Conversations about race at work turn awkward. Stereotyping happens. Exclusion happens. And it is paralleled in two different workplaces: corporate, and nonprofit. </p>

                           <br/><br/>
                           
                      <div class="row">

                        <article class="col-md-8 text-left">
                           <p class="dark">Research conducted by Fordham University researchers Holder, Jackson, and Ponterotto (2015), had a similar goal: to better understand the psychological and social impacts of microaggressions on Black women who have managed to “break through the concrete ceiling” (p.85) at work. Pulling from ten interviews with black women in corporate leadership, Holder et al. (2015) analyzed their statements to form five overall themes of racial microaggressions, three themes about the reactions and consequences of microaggressions, and six themes of coping strategies. </p>

                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Mapping scenes from Insecure’s first episode to this organizational framework, we find that for black women, breaking the “concrete ceiling” (Holder, Jackson, and Ponterotto., 2015, p.84) - so fortified by prejudice that you cannot even see the possibility for career advancement - requires transcendence in more forms than one. To see the data from this mapping exercise, <a href="cfs.html">view the project</a>.
                           </p>

                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Of the microaggressions shown in the show, stereotyping, universality, and exclusion happen the most often. We are introduced to Molly, Issa’s best friend, as the “Will Smith” of corporate life (Rae, 2016). How does this translate? She can make her white colleagues laugh, she can make her black, male, security guard friends respect her, and she excels at her job as a lawyer. In other words, Molly can do it all; she can act every part. This word ‘act’ is key, and seems to be what Issa Rae is alluding to. Just as Will Smith is notable for his ability to play different acting roles, Molly has refined her ability to code-switch between the office and her personal life. 
                           </p>

                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">In coping scenes with Issa, Molly is more emotive and freely expressive, whereas in her professional life she is more refined and attempts to stay “on character.” Where we see this fail her is in her social interactions with her coworkers. In a cringeworthy interaction between Molly and Diane about black men and racial fetishization, Molly seems to be venting about her experiences being undervalued by black men. Diane, who is also a woman of color but is not black, responds that she and her black boyfriend Jamal, “are always talking about how we’re not each other’s types...but, it works!” (Rae, 2016). It’s not clear who is being problematic in this interaction, if either are, but the interaction is uncomfortable, perhaps because it feels like Molly has somehow “lost.” While Molly struggles to maintain a relationship, Diane’s interracial relationship is “working,” and working well. Later in the episode, Diane and Jamal get engaged. And while Diane feels comfortable celebrating this with her colleagues, it feels as if Molly would not get the same attention. Diane and Molly’s discussion, and the social exclusion that follows, are not as bold as they are disconcerting. The office environment requires Molly to be armored in a way that others don’t need to be - and her work persona of excellence demonstrates this.
                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Holder et al. define one form of racial microaggression as the “Assumed Universality of the Black Experience,” wherein coworkers commit comments or actions that suggest all black people have the same experiences, qualities, and perspective (2015). One interviewee captures this in an interaction with her manager: “I have a manager who every single day, I was a walking anomaly for her. I was Black, I was not poorly educated, I had a point of view that was valued… I defied all notions of blackness for her.” (Holder et al., 2015, p.89). We see stereotyping and universality nowhere more than at the nonprofit Issa works for, We Got Y’all. 
                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">At work, Issa is not only the only black female employee but also the only black employee overall. It fosters a culture where additional microaggressions can thrive. All questions about all forms of the black experience - male, female, child, adult - are directed to her. At a workplace that serves primarily students of color, this exclusion from representation is particularly problematic. In a private meeting, Issa’s white boss asks her what “James Baldwin would say is most beneficial for people of color.” In a room of mostly white employees, her colleague expresses that the “poor, poor” students of color they serve “need our guidance more than anything.” She turns to Issa patronizingly, informing her that “educated black women are highly unlikely...but work-focused” (Rae, 2016). 

                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Issa walks into the office breakroom to get coffee, where many of her white colleagues are socializing - notably, without her. One coworker notices Issa and says, “let’s just ask Issa...Issa, what’s on fleek?” (Rae, 2016). This is one of the most clear racial microaggressions in the episode. Her colleagues assume that this word is somehow tied to blackness, and Issa is their black spokesperson, to whom they can ask anything. Her reaction is armored: Issa withholds her knowledge, dismisses the question and leaves. “I know what that shit means,” she says to the audience, “But being aggressively passive is what I do best” (Rae, 2016).
                           </p>

                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Why is being “aggressively passive” one of Issa’s qualities? Likely because she has to be. To provide answers to her white colleagues would be to further solidify her role as black spokesperson, thus making her more vulnerable to microaggressions. Just as Molly shifts into a work persona, Issa keeps her white colleagues guessing about not only her blackness, but what blackness even is, in order to survive the environment.
                           </p>
 

                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Still, of course, there are moments where Issa pushes back against her colleagues’ racism. The confrontations are uncomfortable because of the complex nature of the microaggressions  - was it really intentional? Holder et al. (2015) recognize this in their paper: “modern racism is more likely to be expressed as covert, indirect, and more ambiguous, thus creating challenges in identifying and acknowledging its occurrence (p.84). When coworker Frieda makes some bold assumptions about black women during a meeting, Issa interrupts her: “you’re wrong!” But because Frieda is assumed to have good intentions, her boss rallies behind her. “What is she wrong about, Issa?” her boss says (Rae, 2016). The writers seem to be trying to prompt a conversation about how important intent really is. Why should good intent matter when it still creates a hostile work environment for Issa?
                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">At We Got Y’all and at Molly’s law firm, there does not seem to exist any intent to keep the workforce homogenous. And yet, at both organizations, we only see one black woman employee. Holder et. al (2015) classify this lack of representation as a racial microaggression in and of itself. When diversity is not a part of the company’s strategy, racism thrives.
                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">The examples of nonprofit versus corporate work life show viewers that microaggressions thrive everywhere - and the immediate environments are very different. The law firm is organized, with bright lighting and glass walls. The employees wear suits, and outside of social situations, speak formally to each other. Meanwhile, at We Got Y’all, the rooms are smaller, and aging. A yellowed light is cast upon the employees, who dress casually and drink out of eclectic mugs. The presentations are more relaxed and team members use informal language. Molly serves presumably wealthy clients, while Issa serves low-income public school students of color - and these workplaces never meet or intersect, or even mention each other.
                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Yet at both, there is only one black woman employed (as far as we can tell). At both, the black woman faces some element of social exclusion. Meanwhile, other staff members of color seem not to experience the same microaggressions, and are a part of the social work groups.  The show parallels corporate and nonprofit work to show that microaggressions do not necessarily call home to one type of work; instead, it is the common experience of the black woman at work. 

                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Racism can pervade all forms of work, and so Issa Rae’s presentation of coping is supremely important. Within the show, Molly and Issa talk to each other about the office, write raps, go out, and seek support from romantic relationships. Support is presented as the most dominant form of coping, and we don’t know how or why Issa and Molly are friends, but we know they rely on each other partially because they share similar experiences. 

                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">In a way as well, viewing the show serves as a method of coping. We see ourselves in Issa, in Molly, and in their experiences and so are reminded that in sharing these identities -  Black, and female - we’re not alone. Rae says to Rolling Stone, “In creating and writing the show, this is not for dudes. It’s not for white people. It’s the show that I imagined for my [Black] family and friends. That’s what I think of when I’m writing the scenes.” (Spanos, 2017). As a result, audience members of other identities can learn that these negative experiences have real effect. 

                           </p>


                           <br/><br/>
                           
                           <p class="dark">Finally, the creation of the show serves as a platform for Issa Rae and her team to bring to light issues of race, gender, and more. In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year, Rae describes Insecure’s writer’s room as synonymous with “group therapy” (Spanos, 2017), where the team often shares personal experiences to provide inspiration for the show. It is not unbelievable that the process of making Insecure has been a coping mechanism for the black women involved. And after two seasons, with a third on the horizon, hopefully it will continue to be.
